# Netflix Content Strategy & Quality Audit (1953 - 2022)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs a deep-dive analysis into the Netflix library to identify trends in content quality, audience segmentation, and the historical evolution of the platform. Using **SQL** for data extraction and **Power BI** for strategic storytelling, I identified key "Hidden Gems" and analyzed the performance gap between Movies and TV Shows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Source:** IMDb/Netflix Dataset (5,283 Titles)
* **Database:** MySQL (ETL, Data Cleaning, and Aggregate Analysis)
* **Visualization:** Power BI (DAX, Interactive Dashboards)
